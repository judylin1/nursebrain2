#Nurse Brain 2

https://agile-meadow-6335.herokuapp.com/

This app was created during week 6 of Galvanize's gSchool Full Stack program. It is intended to be an all-inclusive app for nursing professionals. There are multiple calculators included to help nurses calculate the proper doses on the fly as well as a place to look up medications and compare prices of medications.

The resources used to create this app were:
- Node
- Express
- Crypto
- CSS
- Skeleton
- Jade
- DotENV
- Unirest
- GoodRx API
- FDA API
- Twitter Typeahead (includes most frequently prescribed medications)

Known errors:
- The FDA API occasionally returns incorrect drug information. This is a mistake on the FDA's API. You'd think of all people though, they would get their med info right.
